# Critical Security Tests for Upgradeable Contracts

This document describes the critical security tests added to ensure the UUPS upgradeable implementation is production-ready.

## Test Suite Summary

**Total Tests**: 18 (up from 10)
- **Original Tests**: 10 tests covering basic functionality
- **New Critical Security Tests**: 8 tests covering security vulnerabilities

All tests passing ✅

## Critical Security Tests Added

### 1. Initialization Security (2 tests)

#### Test 1.1: Prevent Direct Implementation Initialization
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:395-408`

**What it tests**:
- Verifies that the implementation contract cannot be initialized directly
- Ensures `_disableInitializers()` in constructor works correctly
- Prevents attack where someone initializes implementation and gains ownership

**Attack scenario prevented**:
```
Attacker → IdentityRegistryUpgradeable.initialize()
         → Takes ownership of implementation
         → Could cause confusion or attempt malicious upgrades
```

**Why critical**: Without this protection, an attacker could initialize the implementation contract and potentially cause issues or confusion.

---

#### Test 1.2: Reject Zero Address in Initialization
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:410-422`

**What it tests**:
- Verifies that ReputationRegistry and ValidationRegistry reject zero address for identityRegistry
- Ensures contracts fail fast with clear error message

**Attack scenario prevented**:
```
Attacker → Deploy ReputationRegistry with 0x0000... as identityRegistry
         → Contract deployed but non-functional
         → Causes confusion and wastes gas
```

**Why critical**: Zero address references would cause contract to be non-functional and lead to confusing errors.

---

### 2. Upgrade Authorization (3 tests)

#### Test 2.1: Reject Upgrade to Zero Address
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:426-437`

**What it tests**:
- Verifies that proxy cannot be upgraded to zero address
- Ensures upgrade validation works correctly

**Attack scenario prevented**:
```
Attacker (if owner) → upgradeToAndCall(0x0000...)
                    → Proxy points to zero address
                    → All contract calls fail
                    → Contract effectively bricked
```

**Why critical**: Upgrading to zero address would brick the contract permanently.

---

#### Test 2.2: Reject Upgrade to Non-Contract Address
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:439-451`

**What it tests**:
- Verifies that proxy cannot be upgraded to an EOA (user wallet address)
- Ensures implementation must be a contract

**Attack scenario prevented**:
```
Attacker (if owner) → upgradeToAndCall(userWalletAddress)
                    → Proxy points to wallet (no code)
                    → All contract calls fail with invalid bytecode
                    → Contract effectively bricked
```

**Why critical**: Non-contract addresses have no code, would break all functionality.

---

#### Test 2.3: Ownership Transfer and Upgrade Permissions
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:453-497`

**What it tests**:
- Transfer ownership from owner to newOwner
- Verify old owner can no longer upgrade
- Verify attacker cannot upgrade
- Verify new owner can upgrade
- Verify data persists across ownership transfer + upgrade

**Attack scenario prevented**:
```
Scenario 1:
Former owner → upgradeToAndCall(maliciousImpl)
             → Should fail (no longer authorized)

Scenario 2:
Random attacker → upgradeToAndCall(maliciousImpl)
                → Should fail (never authorized)

Valid scenario:
New owner → upgradeToAndCall(legitimateV2)
          → Should succeed ✅
```

**Why critical**: Ensures upgrade authorization follows ownership correctly, prevents unauthorized upgrades.

---

### 3. Storage Collision Prevention (2 tests)

#### Test 3.1: Complex Storage Preservation
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:501-550`

**What it tests**:
- Creates 5 agents with different URIs
- Stores 4 different metadata entries (nested mapping)
- Upgrades to V2
- Verifies all 5 URIs persist correctly
- Verifies all 4 metadata entries persist correctly
- Verifies can add new data after upgrade

**Storage layout tested**:
```solidity
// Slot assignments that must remain stable:
uint256 private _lastId;                              // Slot 0
mapping(uint256 => mapping(string => bytes)) private _metadata;  // Slot 1
// + ERC721 internal storage slots
// + Ownable internal storage slots
```

**Attack/bug scenario prevented**:
```
Broken V2 with reordered storage:
mapping(...) private _metadata;  // Now in slot 0 (was slot 1)
uint256 private _lastId;         // Now in slot 1 (was slot 0)

Result:
- _metadata reads _lastId's value (data corruption)
- _lastId reads _metadata's keccak hash (wrong value)
- All data appears corrupted or missing
```

**Why critical**: Storage collision is the #1 cause of catastrophic upgrade failures. This test ensures the storage layout is preserved correctly.

---

#### Test 3.2: Nested Mapping Preservation
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:552-625`

**What it tests**:
- Creates complex feedback data structure (2 agents × 2 clients = 4 feedbacks)
- Tests 3-level nested mapping: `mapping(agentId => mapping(client => mapping(index => Feedback)))`
- Upgrades ReputationRegistry
- Verifies all 4 feedbacks persist with correct nested structure

**Storage layout tested**:
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => mapping(uint64 => Feedback))) private agentFeedback;
// This nested structure uses complex keccak256 hashing for storage slots:
// slot = keccak256(keccak256(keccak256(baseSlot . agentId) . client) . index)
```

**Attack/bug scenario prevented**:
```
If storage layout changes:
- Feedback for Agent1-Client1 might read Agent2-Client2's data
- Scores become corrupted
- Reputation system completely broken
- No way to recover correct mappings
```

**Why critical**: Nested mappings are the most complex storage structure. This test ensures even deeply nested data persists correctly across upgrades.

---

### 4. Upgrade Event Emission (1 test)

#### Test 4.1: Upgraded Event with Correct Address
**File**: `test/ERC8004Upgradeable.ts:629-656`

**What it tests**:
- Performs upgrade from V1 to V2
- Captures transaction receipt
- Verifies `Upgraded(address)` event was emitted (EIP-1967 standard)
- Verifies event contains correct new implementation address

**EIP-1967 Standard Event**:
```solidity
event Upgraded(address indexed implementation);
```

**Why critical**:
- Off-chain indexers rely on this event to track upgrades
- Block explorers use this to show implementation address
- Essential for transparency and auditability
- Required by EIP-1967 standard
